  <p>I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science in the College of Computer Studies at
    <a class="focus" href="https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/" target="_blank">De La Salle University</a>,
    Manila, Philippines. Currently, I serve as the Center Head for the
    <a class="focus" href="https://comet.dlsu.edu.ph/" target="_blank">Center for Complexity and Emerging Technologies</a>.
  </p>

  <p>My research in data science focuses more on developing interactive visualization to allow everyone
    and anyone to explore. In line with this, I am passionate about making data more open and accessible
    to develop civic solutions that lead to better citizen engagement. If you are interested to collaborate,
