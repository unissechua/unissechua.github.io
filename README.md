# unissechua.github.io
Code repository for my [personal website](https://unissechua.github.io/) powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The theme was forked from [bogoli/-folio](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/unissechua/unissechua.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/unissechua/unissechua.github.io)

## Dependencies
* Ruby: 2.6.3
* jekyll: 3.8.5

## Set Up
I work on a macOS, but here are some steps to help you get started.

Install the bundler and jekyll gems in your system:

```
$ gem install bundler jekyll
```

Then, install the dependencies included in your `Gemfile` and `_config.yml`, and call `jekyll serve`:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/unissechua/unissechua.github.io.git
$ cd unissechua.github.io/
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You now have a local instance of your Jekyll website that you can access at `localhost:4000`.
